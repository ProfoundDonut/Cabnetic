# Welcome
## About
This is an inventory management system, created in a terminal.  Yeah, its a "light" UI, I know.  I will probably use the basics of this code in the future to create a website/app/mobile app.  But that, for now, is not what this project is about.  As this is in the terminal, I tried to make it as easy to use as possible to use.  Now, for the part your probably waiting for, this allows you to add, edit, and find information about bins, cabinets, or anything else that would be personal inventory.  This would be super useful for moving, or insurance/purposes(I may add a setting for value of the "crate").  This started out as a project to manage stuff in cabinets, cause, you know, you can't generally see in them, so it's hard to id them.  It comes with a standard id system with a default of 2 parameters(this number can be changes, cool, I know), that I started out using as level, and section, then a sequential number as an id, which can be changed to letters, I know, again, so cool.  Anyway, this is dragging on and I should be writing more code for this, so enjoy.
